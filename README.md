# VL.SuperCollider

Library to execute basic SuperCollider tasks in vvvv.
Basically a wrapper around *sclang* that generates simple commands to control the SuperCollider audio server.

Built upon [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/) and [VL.SCSynth](https://github.com/cnisidis/VL.SCSynth).

Warning: **Currently in development!** Don't expect any gentle waltz yet.
